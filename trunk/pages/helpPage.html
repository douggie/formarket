<b> Objectives </b><br>
The event we are going to predict is :<b><i> "Which team will be at the top of the DLF Indian Premier League 2012 points table before April 30th".</b></i> <br><br>
                                You will be given $1000 electronic cash. Your aim is to buy as many shares of the winning team as possible.<br><br>
                          A share of a team that wins will fetch you $1. The player who has the highest number of shares of the winning team wins!
<br>
<b><i>Lots of attractive prices are in store!</b></i>

<b> How to Play</b><br>
Once you enter the trading area, you will find a list of the IPL Teams. <b><i>Current Share Price</b></i> represents the value of a share of the particular team. If you feel that this value should increase- thereby implying that the team has a greater chance of winning- you should simply give a higher value in the <b><i> price goes to...</b></i> section. Similarly, if you feel that the price of the share should go down, give a value lower than the Current Share Price in <b><i>price goes to...</b></i>

</p>
<br>
Note that the Share Price must lie between 0 and 100 cents, excluding 0 and 100 (in way, the share price reflects the probability of that particular team winning).

<br>
In addition to the Trading Table, you'll be given a list of the shares you presently hold, as well as your Trading History.

The <i> Total Cost </i> tells you the amount of money you've spent so far. Mind you, if you click on <i> Sell Holdings</i>, then you're selling ALL shares of that particular team. So exercise this button with caution!
<br>
Your objective would be to drive the market price of the shares of the team you think is going to win. 
<br>
You shouldn't really be worried about the <i>number</i> of shares you are owning. The software takes care of all that on its own.
