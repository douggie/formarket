<font size=5>We would like to thank our mentor, <b><i>Rohit Vallam</b></i>, for all the support and encouragement. We couldn't have done this herculean task without his guidance. Thanks so much, Rohit!

The theoretical machinery was worked out by <b><i>Palash Dey</b></i> and <b><i> Sambaran Bandyopadhyay</b></i>. They did an astonishing job to derive the required equations for the Spherical Scoring Rule.
<br><br>
The implementation and the user-interface was done by <b><i>Anirban Laha</b></i> and <b><i> Suvam Mukherjee</b></i>. They burnt the midnight LCD to make sure that the complicated code hung in place.

This software is based on the Zocalo Prediction Market, created by Chris Hibbert, of the Massachussetts Institute of Technology.

We hope you had a enjoyable interaction with our software. We are students, however, and we must have made a bunch of mistakes- and there certainly is an enormous room for improvement. We would love to have your feedback! Do drop us an email at ipl@live.com
